            <p class="about-paragraph">This is a bootstrap template for web and digital agencies. It is best used for showing portfolio and presenting work in general. Web features, such as preloader, parallax, slideshows, full-screen layout and responsivness, will help you with that. Template is built with SASS following OOCSS principles. The hardest part in development process was customization of parallax. It had to be compatible with swiper.js and also fully responsive. Biggest struggle was author section that has multiple parallax. The three images were not supposed to move at the same time which is not default behaviour of parallax plugin. Also, the text should have shown up on hover. And all of that needed to be responsive. That required high front-end skills.</p>

           <p class="about-paragraph">Template is built with HTML &amp; CSS3. And when I say CSS3 I really mean it. Preloader required CSS3 transitions, transformations and keyframes. Also, you may have noticed linear-gradients. CSS code in this template consists of classes which can be reused. In other words, code is content agnostic. Yes, I really did follow principles of OOCSS. CSS was compiled with SASS which helped me to speed up my workflow. Parallax and sliders are made with jQuery where I also tried to DRY the code and follow the principles of OOP.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">This is a bootstrap template which can be used for promoting your app or any oder product. Although it can be used for portfolio. If you want to impress, parallax mobile frame will help you. All styles are written with scss.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph"> The hardest part was customizing fade in effect in mobile frame which had to follow changing of the screen.

           <p class="about-paragraph">Template is built with HTML &amp; CSS3 following the principles of OOCSS. Gulp helped me to compile Sass and jQuery was used for manipulating parallax, sliding and loading animations. It is worth noting that I divided scss files based on template components and parts: home_slide.scss, second_slide.scss, navgiation.scss and so on. That means that template has multiple scss files which are all combined in one big file. I divided styles like so because I thought it would be better for future user. This way, he/she does not need to go through lots of styles at once.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">This is a sample Rails application and although it sound easy and unprofessional I surely learned a lot. Indeed it is a hypotetical work but it covers development process that is required almost in every application. I am talking about modeling users, users' authentication and authorization. This app allows you to create user, which you have to verify with email, create your microposts, generate your status feed, read other user's profile and status feed, follow and unfollow other users.</p>

            <h2 class="about-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> There were lots of problems, or at least, lots of new stuff so I am going to split it in several slides. First few chapters, which explained basic MVC structure and layouting, was super easy and I was brave enough to think that creating web applications was not so hard after all. I even survived sixth chapter with hashing password and seventh chapter with signing up a user. Everything was clear to me but little did I know I was heading to the land of despair called sessions and cookies. So it hit me in the chapter 8: Log in, log out. For someone who never heard of terms like stateless protocol this was really huge pain. Chapter included some ruby intermediate level of coding so that didn't help either. Luckily, there are some pretty useful resources for learning rails such as RailsCasts which truly helped me with understanding sessions although I'm pretty sure I am not an expert.

            <h2 class="about-title">Exploring Rails</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Next, I had to figure out remembering and forgetting the user. It took me ages to understand all of this at once and even if I did understand some parts, I still had to figure out how do they interact with each other. Action mailer was also new to me and I had problems with putting activation token on my browser.After that following and unfollowing users was waiting for me. Generating a relationship as a model was really hard to digest, logically. We had to differ pasive and active relationship and update database with follower_id and followed_id. Status feed required some hard sql querying.</p>

            <h2 class="about-title">Deployment</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Finally the application was done. So now I just needed to deploy it. And again problems showed up. First I had to switch to another database, Postgres. Then I had to use puma server which I had problems with. I got well known error: Failed to build local extension. After I finally fixed that by installing local dependencies another error popped up: puma load error, no such file or directory. I read heroku logs, detected problem (I misplaced puma.rb file), and fixed it. Then I had to play with account activation via email which required heroku addons. Yes, it does sound trivial to senior developers but I was not one of them. So I had to google every error and luckily community on stack overflow gave me an answers. </p>

           <p class="about-paragraph">Tutorial would have been much difficult if I didn't know front-end technologies and versioning with Git. Whole application was based on test driven development and I had to admit I liked it. Test are written with Rails default testing framework: Unit Tests. I learned about fixtures and difference between integration and controller tests. For profile pictures we used Gravatar API and for uploading images in microposts we used gem mini_magick. Pagination was made with will_paginate gem. And faker helped us create sample users.</p>

            <h2 class="about-title">Conslusion</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> All of this was really hard. Don't believe anyone that learning to code is easy! It's not. It's super hard. But I promised myself not to give up. And I stuck to it. I didn't understand everything and maybe I still don't but I got basic idea. I know I am not Rails developer yet, but I would be glad to become one. The best way to learn something is by building something and that is why I would like to create real-life applications and learn from seniors. Although it took me a lot of time to read this tutorial book, I am fast learner especially if I am surounded with experts.
