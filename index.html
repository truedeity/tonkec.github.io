            <p class="about-paragraph">This is a bootstrap template for web and digital agencies. It is best used for showing portfolio and presenting work in general. Web features, such as preloader, parallax, slideshows, full-screen layout and responsivness, will help you with that. Template is built with SASS following OOCSS principles. The hardest part in development process was customization of parallax. It had to be compatible with swiper.js and also fully responsive. Biggest struggle was author section that has multiple parallax. The three images were not supposed to move at the same time which is not default behaviour of parallax plugin. Also, the text should have shown up on hover. And all of that needed to be responsive. That required high front-end skills.</p>

           <p class="about-paragraph">Template is built with HTML &amp; CSS3. And when I say CSS3 I really mean it. Preloader required CSS3 transitions, transformations and keyframes. Also, you may have noticed linear-gradients. CSS code in this template consists of classes which can be reused. In other words, code is content agnostic. Yes, I really did follow principles of OOCSS. CSS was compiled with SASS which helped me to speed up my workflow. Parallax and sliders are made with jQuery where I also tried to DRY the code and follow the principles of OOP.</p>

Gulp helped me to compile Sass and jQuery was used for manipulating parallax, sliding and loading animations. It is worth noting that I divided scss files based on template components and parts: home_slide.scss, second_slide.scss, navgiation.scss and so on. That means that template has multiple scss files which are all combined in one big file. I divided styles like so because I thought it would be better for future user. This way, he/she does not need to go through lots of styles at once.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph"> There were lots of problems, or at least, lots of new stuff so I am going to split it in several slides. I have gone through several RoR tutorials but that is safe zone for developing application. So first question I had to asked myself was how many models was I going to have? Luckily for me there are only two models in this application: user and grocery. This is simple has_many and belongs_to association. User should be able to sign up, log in and log out. Also he should be able to create, read, update and destroy his groceries.

            <h2 class="about-title">Hardest part?</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">The hardest part was testing. When I was just starting with development process, I did not realize that I was writing tests for default Rails behaviour. In other words, I was testing association between two models. Later I learned it was really unnecessary because Rails had tested it out already. That is why I decided to test only code that I wrote "from scratch", that is not built in Rails. So I tested creating and destroying user and sessions. Testing was the hardest thing for me during development process. The rest was pretty standard. </p>

           <h2 class="about-title">Technologies and principles</h2>
           <p class="about-paragraph">Testing was hard for me as a concept. I did not know what to test exactly. But I wanted to make it even more challenging for myself so I decided to learn Rspec and Capybara. Ok, so now I did not even know syntax. I did not even know how to use Rspec instead of Unit Tests in Rails. Luckily for me there are free tutorials for learning Rspec. I am so glad I pushed myself little harder. After I was feeling comfortable with Rspec, I decided it was time for new challenge: Factory Girl. I did not know where to put factories and how to write them and connect them with tests. I figured it out after reading its documentation and put them in spec directory.</p>

             <h2 class="about-title">Design</h2>
             <p class="about-paragraph">When I finished back-end development I was glad that I could relax and work on layout. Little did I know what was I heading to. I used Materializecss with Sass and bourbon but it has quirks. Materializecss code is not written in OOCSS manners so I had to use !important often. And I am not a fan of that. But the bigger problem was partials. Surely I did not want to repeat same code but I just could not figure out how to reference methods in views from different controllers. For example, calling a current_user method from Helper module in static pages was giving me a headache. But I do not give up, I just change my approach to problem. </p>

            <h2 class="about-title">Deployment</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Finally the application was done. So now I just needed to deploy it. And again problems showed up. First I had to switch to another database, Postgres. Then I had to use puma server which I had problems with. I got well known error: Failed to build local extension. After I finally fixed that by installing local dependencies another error popped up: puma load error, no such file or directory. I read heroku logs, detected problem (I misplaced puma.rb file), and fixed it. Then I had to play with account activation via email which required heroku addons. Yes, it does sound trivial to senior developers but I was not one of them. So I had to google every error and luckily community on stack overflow gave me an answers. </p>

            <h2 class="about-title">Conslusion</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> All of this was really hard. Don't believe anyone that learning to code is easy! It's not. It's super hard. But I promised myself not to give up. And I stuck to it. I didn't understand everything and maybe I still don't but I got basic idea. I know I am not Rails developer yet, but I would be glad to become one. The best way to learn something is by building something and that is why I created real-life applications and learned on the way.

            <p class="about-paragraph">I organized workshop for everyone who wants to learn basics of web-development. It was completely free no matter what background you had, what sex you were or how old you were. The workshop was held in Zagreb. Dozen people showed up and we were learning HTML &amp; CSS. The goal of workshop was to create basic responsive layout with HTML and CSS from scratch. I must say when I first got the idea, I was going to make it free only for girls. Boys would have to pay. Ever since I decided for myself to learn development, I was struck by lack of women. It looked to me liked they have some huge fear from IT section in general. So I wanted to attract more women in IT. But I changed my mind because I know how frustrated I was when something was just for boys. All in all, it was good experience for me because it made me realize how much can I help and encourage someone to at least start learning new technologies if not to seek new career. And I met new people! </p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">Because everything I learned in web-development was given me for free. I am talking about codecademy, youtube tutorials, udemy, coursera and etc. In that time, I would have given anything to find more experienced developer who could show me how to do stuff. So I wanted to give that. And I know when you just starting to learn, you probably do not have lots of money. So you can not learn simply because you do not have money. Not because you are stupid, lazy or do not want to learn. So I said to myself: "this is going to be free for everyone!" And everybody was thinking I have lost my mind. People were approaching me with suspicious minds: "These is really free? For everyone? Everyone?! Who are you working for?". Yes, for everyone and yes completely free.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph"> In every session I explained theory first and then we coded together and practiced what we learned. So every workshop session had live coding. First, I started with basics of internet: how stuff works, what is internet exactly, what is world wide web, how does client and server communicate, what is web development, back-end vs. front-end. Then we started with HTML: what is it used for, how can we master it. After that I explained how CSS helps websites look beautiful and javascript/jQuery make them dance.

            <p class="about-paragraph">We rolled in the deep, with HTML. I explained basic syntax, nesting, basic HTML structure that every page has. Students were challenged with fundemental HTML concepts. I tried to keep theory at minimum at let them write code as much as possible. We started coding with HTML tags. I explained how do they behave, what are they used for, why are they important.

            <p class="about-paragraph">In the next session I introcued them to CSS magic. Tere was lot of stuff to cover. How to link stylesheet with HTML, several selectors, inheritance and cascading principles, box model, positioning, floating, layouting in general. Everything had example on jsfiddle so it was not just boring theory. For inspiration and motivational purposes, I showed them best examples of pure CSS animations on codepen.
